You are a MAPF researcher trying to write the {{ task }} to help task scheduler escape from local optimum.
{{ description }}
{{ modification_direction }}

Your goal is to improve {{ task }} for the task scheduler, after reading and understanding the <key code> of task scheduler below.

As an example, the format of {{ task }} can be:
'''
// start
{{ code_format }}
// end
'''

To replace the original code:
'''
// start
{{ origin_target_code }}
// end
'''

Tips:
1) Your {{ task }} code must start with '''// start''' and end with '''// end'''
2) Feel free to unleash your creativity and provide your improved and correct code. (Pay attention to correct namespace.)
3) Your {{ task }} code must be different from original codes.
4) You can only modify the current {{ task }} and use the existing external variables (e.g. variables that defined in schedule_plan).
5) If you need to add global variables, you can add new global variables before the {{task}} function.
{{ other_tips }}

<key code> of task scheduler is:
"""
{{ origin_key_code }}
"""

Take a deep breath and think it carefully. Then respond in correct format!
